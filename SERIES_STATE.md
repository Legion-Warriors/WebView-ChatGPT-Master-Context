# Series State — Android WebView Content Series

## Current Progress at End of Shared Chat
- Planning/hierarchy complete.
- Arc decomposition complete.
- Hook-first release strategy defined.
- Style constraints and platform strategy clarified.
- **Post 1A drafted/produced** (multi-platform orientation).
- Post 1A theme centered on WebView pre-init/pooling/caching realities and architectural trade-offs without early moral labeling.
- **Post 1A saved for LinkedIn** at `linkedin_posts/Post 1A` ("Inside Android WebView") on February 20, 2026.

## Source of Truth
- Canonical planning source: `LinkedIn_Post_Hierarchy_Conversation.md`
- Canonical working subset: `ANDROID_WEBVIEW_SERIES_ARCS.md`
- Naming scheme: `Post 1A/1B/...`, `Post 2A/2B/...`, `Post 3A/3B/...`

## Continuation Checkpoint (resume from here)
If context is lost, continue with this state:
1. Treat LinkedIn Post 1A as completed baseline content.
2. Next deliverable is Post 1B (session reset boundaries).
3. Preserve the same editorial contract:
   - evidence-first,
   - neutral engineering tone,
   - platform-specific distribution format,
   - practical insights over slogans.
4. Keep each post scoped to one clear technical tension and end with a curiosity-forward bridge to the next post.

## Operating Template for Future Turns
Use this mini-header before generating any next post:

```text
SERIES STATE
- Positioning: Engineering insights on Android WebView at production scale
- Tone: Professional, neutral, evidence-based
- Completed: Post 1A (LinkedIn saved)
- Next: Post 1B (Arc 1)
- Output needed: LinkedIn + Twitter + Medium + image prompts
- Constraints: no myths/no fabricated claims/no dev-team shaming
```
