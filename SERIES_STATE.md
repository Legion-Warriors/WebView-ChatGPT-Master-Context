# Series State — Android WebView Content Series

## Current Progress at End of Shared Chat
- Planning/hierarchy complete.
- Arc decomposition complete.
- Hook-first release strategy defined.
- Style constraints and platform strategy clarified.
- **Post 1 drafted/produced** (multi-platform orientation).
- Post 1 theme centered on WebView pre-init/pooling/caching realities and architectural trade-offs without early moral labeling.

## Continuation Checkpoint (resume from here)
If context is lost, continue with this state:
1. Treat Post 1 as completed baseline content.
2. Next deliverable should proceed to the next planned post in the hook-first roadmap.
3. Preserve the same editorial contract:
   - evidence-first,
   - neutral engineering tone,
   - platform-specific distribution format,
   - practical insights over slogans.
4. Keep each post scoped to one clear technical tension and end with a curiosity-forward bridge to the next post.

## Operating Template for Future Turns
Use this mini-header before generating any next post:

```text
SERIES STATE
- Positioning: Engineering insights on Android WebView at production scale
- Tone: Professional, neutral, evidence-based
- Completed: Post 1
- Next: Post 2 (hook-first sequence)
- Output needed: LinkedIn + Twitter + Medium + image prompts
- Constraints: no myths/no fabricated claims/no dev-team shaming
```
